# Demonstration data for learning purposes
These .csv files have proven useful to me as sample datasets to use while learning the Unix filters `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. I hope whoever finds them finds them just as valuable.

## greeks.csv
Very small dataset featuring some of your favorite ancient philosophers
```csv
name,city,dob
Socrates,Athens,470 BC
Plato,Athens,428 BC
Aristotle,Stagira,384 BC
Euclid,Alexandria,325 BC
Pythagoras,Samos,570 BC
```

## ships.csv
A somewhat larger, more complicated dataset featuring some of history's worthiest battleships
```csv
name,country,displacement,length,beam,commissioned
Yamato,Japan,65027,256,38.9,16 December 1941
USS Enterprise,United States of America,19800,251.4,33.4,12 May 1938
Bismarck,Germany,41700,251,36,24 August 1940
HMS Dreadnought,United Kingdom,18120,160.6,25,2 December 1906
USS Iowa,United States of America,46000,270.43,32.97,22 February 1943
HMS Vanguard,United Kingdom,45200,248.2,32.9,12 May 1946
